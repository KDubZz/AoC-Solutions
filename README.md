# Hi there!

I'm Kshitij, a 4th form at St. Paul's School. I've been coding for a long time now, but recently moved from smaller-scale side-works to full scale projects, starting with the 2022 AoC.


### Navigation

This is the **AoC** repository. My other projects (if I've made them) are located in other repos.

# Advent of Code
>[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

This is my efforts in the Advent of Code, all years. Note that I didn't complete previous years in their respective year (save for 2022) but have still organised them into folders.
### Expectations:
Things to expect from my code:
- Bugs
- Poor time efficiency
- Unreadable code
- Single letter variables (until I can be bothered to go back and make my solutions neat)
